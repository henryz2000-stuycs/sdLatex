### TeX and LaTeX

- TeX: Macro- and token- based language and typesetting system; focus on formatting
- LaTeX: script-like user interface to the binary TeX program, considered a higher-level language; focus on content
- LaTeX commands are just complicated sets of TeX commands underneath AKA “macros”
  - Includes setting up sections, title pages, bibliographies
```
\TeX{} is good at typesetting words like `fjord', `efficiancy',
and `fiasco'. It is also good at typesetting math like,
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
